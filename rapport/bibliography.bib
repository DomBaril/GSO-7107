abstract = {Advances in hardware design have made wheeled mobile robots (WMRs) exceptionally mobile. To fully exploit this mobility, we present a novel dynamic model formulation for use in WMR planning, control, and estimation systems. The formulation is high fidelity, general, modular, and fast. It builds on our prior work on recursive methods for 3-D kinematics derivation and constrained motion prediction using differential algebraic equations. It is stable, even for large integration steps, and can enforce realistic nonlinear models of wheel-terrain interaction. Simulation tests show our dynamic models to be more functional, stable, and efficient than common alternatives. Simulations can run over 1K× faster than real time on an ordinary PC. Experimental results on multiple platforms and terrain types show that, once calibrated, our models predict motion accurately. To facilitate their use, we have released open-source MATLAB and C++ libraries implementing our modeling/simulation methods.},

	abstract = {This work aims at improving real-time motion control and dead-reckoning of wheeled skid-steer vehicles by considering the effects of slippage, but without introducing the complexity of dynamics computations in the loop. This traction scheme is found both in many off-the-shelf mobile robots due to its mechanical simplicity and in outdoor applications due to its maneuverability. In previous works, we reported a method to experimentally obtain an optimized kinematic model for skid-steer tracked vehicles based on the boundedness of the instantaneous centers of rotation (ICRs) of treads on the motion plane. This paper provides further insight on this method, which is now proposed for wheeled skid-steer vehicles. It has been successfully applied to a popular research robotic platform, pioneer P3-AT, with different kinds of tires and terrain types.},

	abstract = {Skid-steer drive systems are widely used in mobile robot platforms. Such systems are subject to significant slippage and skidding during normal operation due to their nature. The ability to predict and compensatefor such slippages in the forward kinematics of these types of robots is of great importance and provides the means for accurate control and safe navigation. In this work, we propose a new kinematic model capable of slip prediction for skid-steer wheeled mobile robots (SSWM Rs). The proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of both translational and rotational prediction error on a dataset composed of more than 6 km worth of trajectories traversed by a skid-steer robot. We also publicly release our dataset to serve as a benchmark for system identification and model learning research for SSWMRs.},

@article{Brach2011,
	abstract = {The tire-force ellipse and tire-force circle (more frequently referred to as the friction ellipse and the friction circle, respectively) have been used for many years to qualitatively illustrate the concept of tire-road force interaction, particularly the force-limiting behavior for combined braking and steering (combined tire forces). Equations of the tire-force circle/ellipse, or, more specifically, the force limit envelope, in its idealized form have also been used in the development of quantitative models of combined tire forces used in vehicle dynamic simulation software. Comparisons of this idealized tire-force circle/ellipse using a simple bilinear tire force model and using actual tire data show that it provides only a limited, simplified notion of combined tire forces due to its lack of dependence upon the slip angle and traction slip. Furthermore, these comparisons show that the idealized tire-force circle/ellipse does not represent actual tire behavior, even approximately, since it is incapable of modeling the nonlinear behavior of tires. For this reason, the idealized tire-force circle/ellipse should not be used as a quantitative tire-force model particularly because superior validated models of nonlinear behavior of tires exist and are widely available. Here a development is presented of a more realistic version of the tire-force circle/ellipse which incorporates slip angle, traction slip and the actual nonlinear tire-force. Because of the complexity of nonlinear tire force behavior the F y - F x force relationship is not a true ellipse and the force limit is dependent on the kinematic slip angle and traction slip variables, {\^{I}}± and s, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2011 SAE International.},

@article{Maclaurin2011,
	abstract = {The paper describes a computer model for predicting the steering performance and power flows of a notional skid steered tracked vehicle. The force/slip characteristics of the rubber track pads are calculated by means of the so-called Magic Formula. Relevant parameters for the Magic Formula are derived from the limited amount of data available from traction tests with a tracked vehicle on a hard surface. The computer model considers the vehicle in steady state motion on curves of various radii and allows for lateral and longitudinal weight transfer, roll and pitch motions and the effects of track tension forces. Vehicle dimensions, Magic Formula parameters and the equations of motion are set up in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and solutions obtained using the Solver routine. Model outputs are described in terms of driver control input and various power flows against lateral acceleration. Maximum lateral acceleration is generally limited by the available engine power. In some conditions the outer track sprocket could be transmitting almost twice the maximum net engine power. For vehicles with a single electric motor/inverter driving each sprocket, these units would need to be able to transmit these high intermittent powers. {\textcopyright} 2011 ISTVS.

This framework supports many different kinematic configurations of wheeled robots and was experimentally verified on eight different real-world robotic platforms, including Ackermann steering, bi-steerable, skid-steered, differentially-driven and omnidirectional vehicles. The real-world experiments include indoor and outdoor tests, on various terrain types, driving up to 6 m/s. The framework provides A*-based path planning algorithms, high speed obstacle avoidance (tested at speeds up to 2.5 m/s) and twelve different control algorithms for path following. In this paper, we present the whole framework, detail every controller and provide an extensive experimental evaluation of the most important components. The entire framework is already open-source available, written in C++ and based on ROS (Robot Operating System).},

	abstract = {In subarctic and arctic areas, large and heavy skid-steered robots are preferred for their robustness and ability to operate on difficult terrain. State estimation, motion control and path planning for these robots rely on accurate odometry models based on wheel velocities. However, the state-of-the-art odometry models for skid-steer mobile robots (SSMRs) have usually been tested on relatively lightweight platforms. In this paper, we focus on how these models perform when deployed on a large and heavy (590 kg) SSMR. We collected more than 2 km of data on both snow and concrete. We compare the ideal differential-drive, extended differential-drive, radius-of-curvature-based, and full linear kinematic models commonly deployed for SSMRs. Each of the models is fine-tuned by searching their optimal parameters on both snow and concrete. We then discuss the relationship between the parameters, the model tuning, and the final accuracy of the models.},
